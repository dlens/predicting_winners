# Sin(x) predicting with neural networks
Running sin.py will give you a decent visual representation of my neural networks estimation of the function sin(x). This file is run using an anaconda installation of python and is powered by tensorflow.

# Code layout
* [sin.py](sin.py): This is where my code for having a neural network predcict sin(x) is located.
* [something.py](something.py): an old file where I was experimenting with matplotlib
* [testing/training]: these are the files containing the testing and training data for the sin.py program.
